# Currency Rates Demo

## Description:
The Currency Rates Demo is a fun project showcasing currency exchange rate tracking on iOS using SwiftUI. With a sprinkle of MVVM magic, we keep things organized, separating UI from logic seamlessly.

## Key Features:

1. **SwiftUI UI Layer**: Leveraging the power of SwiftUI, the project offers a visually appealing and dynamic user interface for tracking currency exchange rates.
2. **MVVM Design Pattern**: The use of MVVM architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with models representing the data, views presenting the UI, and view models handling the presentation logic.
3. **Navigation Stack with Coordinators**: Navigation within the app is managed using a NavigationStack, orchestrated by dedicated coordinators. Each navigation flow has its own coordinator, promoting a modular and scalable navigation structure.

## To-Do:

1. **Add UI Components**: Enhance the UI by adding necessary components for displaying currency exchange rates and facilitating user interaction.
2. **Implement Mocked Networking Layer**: Develop a mocked networking layer to simulate fetching currency exchange rate data from external APIs every 2 seconds.
3. **Incorporate Presentation Logic**: Implement presentation logic within view models to handle data manipulation, formatting, and interaction with the UI components.
